                    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
                    <p>I'm really focused right now at becoming a full-stack or front-end web developer. I believe that once I do that, and work for a few years I'll have a better idea of where I want my career to do - maybe freelance, or possibly to become a game dev.</p>

                    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adaptability: stress tolerance, managing expectations</li>
                        <li>Communication: oral communication - interviews or presentations</li>
                        <li>Confidence</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
                    <p>My strengths include curiousity, enthusiasm, and focus. I'd like to think that I'm considerate, hard-working, and persistent. I'm precise and meticulous, which can just as easily be a weakness in the form of perfectionism. My major limitation would be ADHD/ADD really, and it's associated complications: forgetfulness, distractibility, disorganisation, and poor time-management. I am fairly shy, reserved, and averse to conflict, which while I don't always view as a limitation but can be a source of stress. My other major limitation would be my tendency to place high expectations on myself, and to become very self-critical and frustrated when I see myself as falling short of them.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
                    <p>I'm not organised by nature, but I'm making a concious effort to spend time at the start of every week of Foundations to plan the week ahead and block off time to work on each exercise, and make sure that I still have time for when I (inevitably) will need longer to complete certain things. I'll probably expand this system when it comes to working with others.</p>
                    <p>I'm using Google Calendar and Tasks for reminders, and using Toggl to keep track of time spent and to remind myself to take regular breaks. I've created a dedicated space for study, and noise-cancelling headphones and music are a huge help dealing with distractibility.</p>
                    <p>Being more organised, more mindful and forgiving of my ADHD will help to ground my expectations and prevent me from falling into negative thought patterns of frustration and relentless self-criticism.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
                    <p>I tend to try to solve problems on my own, and can struggle to ask for help or realise that I need help. What I'm going to attempt in order to counteract this is to include in my planning checkpoints where if I'm still struggling to understand what I have to do for an exercise, I know to reach out to facilitators and fellow learners on Slack.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                    <p>Guidance, in the form of where to find answers and clarification of exercise objectives, and encouragement.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
                    <p>I don't really have any regular commitments so I'm fairly flexible, but I would like to try and keep a few evenings per week from ~6 on free just to give myself time to recharge.</p>
