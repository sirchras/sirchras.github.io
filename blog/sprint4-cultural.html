        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <!--

        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new, and reorganise existing connections to learn new things, and adapt to new situations. When learning something new the brain creates new connections between networks of neurons. When the brain needs to adapt to new situations it can emphasise connections and de-emphasise others. These connections grow stronger with reuse, or weaker with disuse. This all happens unconsiously on a daily basis, but ways to encourage this process have been discovered/studied.
        </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Good sleep</li>
          <li>Regular exercise</li>
          <li>Mindfulness meditation</li>
          <li>Learning something new: a language, an instrument</li>
          <li>Reading, and expanding one's vocabulary</li>
          <br>
          <li>(ADHD specific) Stimulant medication</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h4>
        <p>
          As someone with ADHD having a greater awareness of neuroplasticity is quite beneficial. Whereas in the past I unconsciously developed coping mechanisms to manage, like caffeine consumption and anxiety. Being more aware allows me to manage more consciously, reworking old and devising new strategies.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          Fixed and Growth Mindset are two categories proposed by psychologist Carol Dweck, to group individuals based on their reaction to failure, and beliefs on where ability comes from. According to Dweck a growth mindset is the belief that ability is aquired rather than innate and can be developed. People with this mindset view failure is temporary setback that can be overcome with effort and study. Dweck argues that people with a growth mindset are more likely to continue working despite setbacks, and will be less stressed and more successful.
        </p>

        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
        <p>
          During the exploration, while researching I spent a lot of time thinking about which mindset was more dominant for me at various points in the past. Because through-out there's been a sense that I could succeed with hard work, but a lot of anxiety and frustration around big life changes inspired by fear that I innately lacked the necessary abilities. There's also times I've achieved things, and overcome failures driven less by a sense that I could overcome with effort than an anger at, and a fear of, failing.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently I've been trying to keep a more Growth Mindset. I really liked Carol Dweck's TED talk about the power of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU">"yet"</a>, it spoke to how I've been trying to practice more self-compassion in the face of setbacks. I've also been trying to believe in myself more, and be more aware of my strengths and weaknesses.
