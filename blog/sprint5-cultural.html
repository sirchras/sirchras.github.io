        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The way neuroplasticity relates to ADHD/ADD, and the mechanisms I've developed to handle it</li>
          <li>The benefit of spending about ~1 hr at the start of the week, to organise/plan workload, even if the plan falls apart somewhat later in the week</li>
          <li>How my mindset has shifted gradually away from a fixed mindset since ADHD/ADD treatment, and starting Foundations</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        <!-- [A good primer on values, beliefs, etc.](https://www.iaa.govt.nz/for-advisers/adviser-tools/ethics-toolkit/personal-beliefs-values-attitudes-and-behaviour/) -->

        <p>
          Self awareness: the aphorism "know thyself" has been around since ancient Greece. Being aware of your strengths and limitations, and those areas you can improve is important to focus your learning. And it's a bad programmer who doesn't continue to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy: "No man is an island" - John Donne. Since learning and programming are more often that not communal activities, empathy for others and for oneself is critical. Being able to understand and care for others is necessary to working well in a communal space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values: the things we believe are important, guide our choices and actions, and thus intersect with learning and programming. The more we understand our values, the better we can make consistent decisions to advance our learning/programming.
        </p>

        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          How daunting aspects of it appeared initially, and then how enjoyable and interesting they all were.
        </p>

        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          The main challenge I found was putting my thoughts on the learning into words, especially words that I was satisfied with. Another challenge, when it came to things like listening and looping, was managing anxiety in those moments.
        </p>

        <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
        <p>
          Programming ability alone doesn't make someone a good programmer, they need to be able to work in a team effectively, which is why the core learning is so important. The ability to be reflective and self-aware, being able to communicate effectively, and being able to empathise and undertand team members is necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
        <p>
          No, the core learning gave me a lot of insights into myself, how I learn and process things. The practice of being reflective was something I found really invaluable, taking the time to sort through my thoughts and feelings. I also really enjoyed learning about the concepts and applying them to my own experience, and thinking about ways to apply them going forward.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Plan</h3>

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          I don't have an exact destination in mind so much, ADHD/ADD makes planning that a little hard. I've gone back and forth on the question of whether I want this to be my career in the past, but I've loved programming since I discovered it and I want to be seen, and see myself, as good at it. I also would like to use my skills to help people somehow. I don't have a very clear idea of what that looks like at the moment, but I thought at some point it would likely take the form of passing my skills along, teaching others. For now I'm focused on becoming a web developer, either full stack or front-end.
        </p>

        <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>Strengths:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Curiousity</li>
          <li>Focused</li>
          <li>Enthusiasm</li>
          <li>Problem solving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time-management</li>
          <li>High self-expectations + Perfectionism</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
        <p>
          Speaking in front of the group. I've always struggled with speaking in front of people, since high-school where is was compulsory (esp. in English class, and occasional assignments in other subjects). Ever since then I've usually made sure to avoid things that would force me into that position - not taking specific papers @ uni. A notable exception in my mind was the cause of an almost full-blown panic.
        </p>

        <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
        <!-- No change from S2 -->
        <ul>
          <li>Adaptability: stress tolerance, managing expectations</li>
          <li>Communication</li>
          <li>Confidence</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>
          I'm going to continue to work on my time-management, and using Google Calendar/Tasks and Toggl have been invaluable when it comes to this. Using the Pomodoro technique to ensure I take regular focus breaks, and making sure that I'm not tired, dehydrated, or hungry so that I am working sustainably at my best. Additionally being patient and compassionate with myself and others, taking the time to communicate clearly where I'm at with others, and seeking help from others before I get overwhelmed.
