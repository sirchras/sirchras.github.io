                    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                    <p>One time I had let someone down, I had said I would do something but came to realise (a little too late) that I had over-promised. When I realised I couldn't follow through I procrastinated, I didn't want to confront them and admit that I couldn't do what I said I would. Instead, feeling defensive and guilty I avoided them, and hoped that it would blow over. When a mutual friend told me later that our friend was still hurt by my actions I realised that I had been acting selfishly and this whole situation was unfair for my friend and so I apologised. Fortunately my friend forgave me and we stayed friends.</p>
                    <p>Shut down a friend's politically incorrect jokes at another friend's(at the time an aquaintance) expense, that was clearly making them uncomfortable. I wasn't totally aware at the time of all the dynamics, but grokked intuitively that the situation was unfair and unwelcoming. As a result I became close friends with the person I defended</p>

                    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
                    <p>My parent's when raising my siblings and me were careful to be as fair as they could, giving us all the same opportunities, which informs my sense of fairness and equality. Curiousity was another value informed by my ubringing, especially when I was younger (primary school age) my parents were very active in encouraging my learning both in and out of school - lots of books and some educational games. When we were living overseas (esp. in the UK) we spent a lot of time visiting historic sites. Additionally the overwhelming majority of my family has completed tertiary education, so academic pursuit was the normal.</p>
                    <p>Another thing that was pretty influential in forming my values and identity would be religion, although I am agnostic. Most schools I've attended have been some denomination of Christian, and at high school there was relious services and education. It's here that values like altruism, honesty, fairness, and tolerance were reinforced for me.</p>
                    <!-- <p>More recently, especially since 2016 (perhaps earlier, ~2014), my values have led me to more left-wing ideas, which have in turn reinforced those existing values of equality, fairness, tolerance, and social justice.</p> -->
                    
                    <p>In terms of strengths and limitations my ADHD/ADD, which went undiagnosed until this year, has a large influence. When my interest is engaged I am curious, hard-working (focused), enthusiastic, and passionate. Because it has been a struggle I've had to be persistent, and I've had to be resourceful and precise/meticulous to work around my limitations - shy/reserved and confrontation averse, and forgetful and distractable respectively. ADHD/ADD also causes time-blindness and a low tolerance for frustration and has influenced my perfectionism, self critical, and high self-expectation.</p>

                    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                    <p>In terms of my learning and career development my curiousity, enthusiasm, and hard-work have always served me well. With career development in particular my high self-expectations, self-criticism, and low tolerance for frustration have made it hard to apply for jobs in the past</p>

                    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curious</li>
                        <li>Hard-working/Focused</li>
                        <li>Enthusiastic</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Curiousity and enthusiasm means that I can become distracted/enamored with a specific aspect/topic and forget about the rest of what it is I'm working on. Enthusiasm can lead me to having high/unrealistic expectations of myself and the project/task, which in turn leads to perfectionism and a lot of self-criticism. When this is mixed with hard-work and focus I wind up exhausting myself on something when my efforts would have been better saved for something else.</p>
                    <p>When working with an unhealthy mindset, like the one described, I am prone to burning out quickly as my mounting exhaustion leads to careless mistakes, and frustration at the gap between my expectations and reality.</p>

                    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
                    <p>Working on a group project at uni, the source of tension were my unrealistic expectations. I was very excited to work on the project and in my/our enthusiasm I/we made the scope too large. At the time I don't think I managed very well at all, or used any strategies. I saw myself falling short of the ridiculous scope and became very critical of myself and the others. My communication suffered as I burned out, and only the threat of the deadline looming stopped me from obsessing over the details. In hindsight I should have been more realistic about my abilities, at the time I had particularly high self-expectations as the previous year I had seriously burnt out. I should have let someone else take the lead, and taken a step back and relinquished the sense of ownership I felt toward the group's project. Something I wished we had done better was limiting the scope, and planning better. Because of high expectations neither scope nor plan were realistic and it lead to a lot of crunch towards the end of the project, all of which could have been avoided.</p>
