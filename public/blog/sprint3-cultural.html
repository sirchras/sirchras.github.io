                    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p>An awareness of one's own emotions and the emotions of others, and the ability to manage one's own emotions. There are several academic models of emotional intelligence, each with their own proponents and critics, but broadly speaking each model includes the ability to percieve emotion, understand emotion, manage emotion, and think with/about emotion.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                    <p>IQ is a measure which attempts to estimate the abstract concept of intelligence. It is considered reliable only at measuring a narrow type of intelligence associated with academic performance. More specifically the test seeks to measure abilities including a person's general knowledge, ability to solve novel problems, and working and short-term memory. So a high IQ score would not necessarily mean a high level of emotional intelligence, which is concerned with emotion rather than abstract reasoning.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h3>
                    <p>The value of the components of emotional intelligence, such as emotional awareness and management, speak for themselves, although developing a higher emotional intelligence is correlated with many benefits. These benefits include better communication, motivation, and stress management, all of which can help achieve a greater level of success, happiness, and fulfilment.</p>
